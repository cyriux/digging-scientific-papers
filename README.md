# DIGGING Deep into any domain by DIGGING scientific papers

⚠️ Beware: going through this rabbit hole may become a life-defining goal! It happened for friends, that's how they he felt into system theory for example!

## Step 1 - Acknowledge you’re trying to better understand something 

First try to write down the theme you’d like to explore, in your own words.


## Step 2 - Start somewhere 

Start from a random paper

- From a web search + "citation"
- From an AI chatbot

Tip: Exclude pseudo scientific stuff, if it’s not boring enough it may not be serious

## Step 3 - Jump to the Related works section: that’s usually a well-written overview of everything you need to know. And it’s not done by AI.

- Notice the terminology: relevant terms, how it’s named, often with boring unappealing work. 
- Go back to the beginning of the field history. The most interesting proposition often happened in the early years. 
- Note the key foundational papers in the field -> go read these immediately if you’re excited. You don’t have to finish a paper. 
- Skim through the body of the paper
- Skim the Conclusion section and Read quickly the Discussion section to get deeper insights.

## Step 4 - Spend time on the Bibliography section

- Now skim through the bibliography section and find and explore the paper that look most exciting to you. 
- Once you identify a good author, you may want to go through their other papers. (search online)

## What about bad papers?

That's more advanced. Look at the actual experiments. If it's a survey of 17 students that need to accomplish a task using or not using a technique, it's scientific on the surface but I will not believe it strongly.

## What about AI?

Ask what you want to learn directly. You want to hint that you want scientific answers: "I'm doing research in academia. Be very specific. Link to the the sources. Give me the links so that I can check."

⚠️ beware hallucinations: 
- LLMs can mix-up the keywords for the field, or conflate fields (Keep in mind that research keywords are textual tags, it's not really about semantics) 
- Check each link and do what’s before, beware that AI summaries may lack the actual insight or depth (there's often a dilution or averaging effect)



## Debrief 

- What content did you learn?
- What did you learn about the approach?
